In a time where hours of produced video/audio content is produced every second, and we are all living busy lives being critical with our information diet is crucial, and being able to consume the most amount of signal to noise ratio in the shortest amount of time will make us superhuman.
We often don't have time to watch/listen to a 3 hour podcast, so we want to get the summary in a textual format and possibly links to the most important parts.

~*Tangent*~ Which can then be uploaded as "shorts" for others to consume the labor of what we have done.

### Processing transcripts and removing the noise using SpaCy
SpaCy is a powerful natural language processing library in Python that can be used to extract useful information from interview transcripts, educational videos, and other text-based data. Here are some other ways to use SpaCy for extracting information:

Named Entity Recognition (NER): SpaCy's NER capabilities can identify and classify named entities in text. This can be useful for extracting names, dates, locations, organizations, and more from transcripts. For example, you can extract the names of interviewees, dates mentioned in the video, or the names of institutions.

´´´python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
text = "During the interview, Elon Musk discussed SpaceX and Tesla, Inc., which are both innovative companies."
doc = nlp(text)

for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"Entity: {ent.text}, Label: {ent.label_}")
´´´

Sentiment Analysis: You can use SpaCy in conjunction with a machine learning model to perform sentiment analysis on the text. This can help you gauge the overall sentiment expressed in the interview or video.

Keyphrase Extraction: You can extract keyphrases or important terms from the text to understand the main topics discussed. This can be helpful for generating tags or summaries.

Dependency Parsing: SpaCy's dependency parsing can be used to understand the grammatical structure of sentences. This can help you identify subject-verb-object relationships and analyze how ideas are connected in the text.

Text Classification: If your interview transcripts contain different categories or themes, you can use SpaCy to build a text classification model to categorize each transcript into its respective theme or topic.

Language Model-Based Summarization: SpaCy can be used in conjunction with other libraries to create extractive or abstractive text summaries of the transcripts. You can extract the most important sentences or generate concise summaries of the content.

Part-of-Speech Tagging: SpaCy provides part-of-speech tagging, which can help identify the roles of words in sentences. You can use this to extract verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc., to gain insights into the language used in the transcripts.

Relation Extraction: If you want to identify relationships between entities or concepts mentioned in the text, SpaCy can be used to extract such relations. For example, you can identify that "Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX."

Conversational Analysis: For interview transcripts, you can use SpaCy to analyze conversational patterns, such as who is speaking, when, and the flow of the conversation.

Custom Named Entity Recognition: You can train SpaCy's NER model to recognize custom entities specific to your domain, such as product names, technical terms, or unique identifiers mentioned in the transcripts.

These are just a few examples of how SpaCy can be leveraged for information extraction and analysis in the context of interview transcripts and educational videos. Depending on your specific use case, you can combine different SpaCy features and techniques to derive valuable insights from text data.
