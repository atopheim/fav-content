and he was like I'm Gonna Learn man and then he goes and he gives a talk I think he does it gives a talk to a
Chinese Universe he gave me an interview they go he they fly him out there they're like thank you so much Mark Zuckerberg for coming we are so happy to
have you and he's like he's like yo well Mitchell and he just starts speaking Chinese and they're like blown away it's
like really great Amanda where he's basically fluent and so the guy kills it
man he does great and like when he did the E4 so he got into e-foiling which is basically surfboarding without a wave
and he is doing it with an American flag and he has too much sunscreen on his face that's my guy a guy whose biggest
like flaw is that he's goofy it's not the I know my guy and then now that I
said you're zagging the other way you're saying Zuck bad move unrelatable too too
good no vulnerability no no relatability now he's no longer Girl Next Door hot
now he's just super model hot it sucks the best man he just he you know our friend Nikita beer uh has this joke
where he said something like I would never I forget why he says this but he says never ever ever bet against Zuck
how he's just a complete killer and he is wrong sometimes but not in the grand scheme and this is for the proof well
the funny thing is people will hate this segment because I think it's popular to really hate Mark Zuckerberg
um because they hate Facebook I think because they're like my data or like the
Russians hacked the election I'm not even sure I'm not even sure what the what the exact reason is for hating
Zuckerberg at this point I just gotta say like this is
I mean he he is inspiring in that he is excellent and if you appreciate Excellence that is kind of inspiring
it's kind of like people who hate LeBron it's like okay I get it you don't have to like the guy but uh I mean you gotta
respect that puts a perspective on this guy's name is wrong either by the way like people played sometimes
yeah exactly yeah it might yeah he switched teams when he was a free agent um my real estate agent told me the
story that she was driving my she's like that's Mark Zuckerberg's house in the in the mission kind of like near Dolores Park type of
area and I was like he lives here and I was like that's not like I thought he'd live in some private gated community and
she was like well let me think he has like many houses but this is one this is one and this is like his main one for a while
and she's like and he made it private I said what do you mean I don't see any fence and she's like no he bought the
houses next door like he just bought all the houses in the area so that like you know whatever and so he he knocked on
someone's door himself so somebody opened the door and it was Mark Zuckerberg outside and he's like
hey you know I love this house and I would you sell it to me and they're like
no I mean it's not for sale we love this house we're so close to the park you know my commute it's only seven miles he's like I'll give you 10 million
dollars and you're like okay here's the keys basically he bought the house for 10 million it was probably a two million
dollar house uh and the house next like the house is nearby two and a half three billion dollars and he paid ten and just
got the house right away dude that person who sold their house to him would be the best dinner guest imagine that
story we'd like to have you on air if that's you we would like to have you come tell that story because uh
obviously I'm reenacting what I was told by a real estate agent I don't know if that's that's true or that's [ __ ]
um so yeah Zuck amazing Let's uh wrap up with this last thing this Nike thing
did you watch this movie uh air yeah I did I thought it was awesome it was
pretty sweet right like uh not the best movie but like a just a solid base hit on a Thursday night a Friday night you
know you just need something that's I don't want to sit here and browse Netflix for the perfect thing all right I'm just gonna go on I think
it's on Amazon and I'm just gonna go watch air and like this just watch the story of how Nike signed Michael Jordan they made
Phil Knight look like a doofus yeah why did they do that I didn't understand that they uh well he does
like appearance-wise look like a doofus but they also made him act like a doofus yeah which I don't think he was like
that when I read true dog I didn't get that idea he he he he he's more I think uh they made him look like when he wrote
his own Memoir he made himself sound cool well I've read a lot I've read a lot about him he he they just kind of
made him look like a like a like a ditzy person like an idiot yeah he's not an idiot
um but the guy they feature so a couple things so so first uh anything stand out from the movie air but then I have I
want to go deep on this guy Sonny Vaccaro because I think he's actually more interesting who was that the main character I don't
remember his name that's that's the main character so that's Matt Damon uh Matt Damon in the movie but um you know in in
Nike in the air movie I thought one one is something I didn't know was they're they're talking about just do it which
is the just do it's the slogan that you know everybody knows it's the Nike kind of like iconic slogan and they were
talking about like at the time even people internally were like just do it like they got that from the Ad Agency Wyden Kennedy and they're like I don't
know what what does that what does that mean do you like it it's like I don't know it's okay I guess they weren't like yes this is this is gonna be this like
marketing Masterpiece and they go what does that even mean and they go dude it's from an inmate on death row who was
about to be assassin about to be executed and they were like any last words and he goes just do it
so that became the Nike slogan which is uh honestly kind of Genius
um so I want to talk about this guy Sonny Vaccaro because he's kind of a gangster that I've seen for many many years in
the basketball scene and the movie was about him and he this guy's pretty fascinating so
what uh in the movie he's famous because he's working at Nike at the time Nike is
the last player it's just a running shoe company and they're the smaller shoe company uh Adidas is This Global brand
that's crushing it they own most of the sneaker Market uh I believe it's pronounced Adidas yeah Adidas
which has its own interesting story then Reebok is like number two and Nike's
like a distant three but they were doing like 27 million a year in sales through their running shoot so good but not like
nowhere near the kind of top tier uh of shoe companies and so Sunny meets Phil
Knight and he's like hey I got an idea for a basketball shoe I want to create like a basketball Division like you guys are all running shoes which is great
basketball shoes and he's like okay like come on in and you get this little basketball Department like go ahead try
to make it work and the movie is all about like one breakthrough thing he did which was
they had a tiny budget and in the 1984 draft they decided to sponsor Michael
Jordan and Michael Jordan was not interested in Nike he was going to go with uh I think Adidas or somebody like
that and um he was known as a hot Prospect he's like the number three pick and they were like
well we still want and and Sonny was convinced we need Michael Jordan and so the movie's about them trying to go get
Michael Jordan on Borden and what ended up what they what the pitch was was basically they put her entire Budget on
one guy instead of spreading across multiple players he relentlessly pursued Jordan and like
met his mom and like just like drove out there to North Carolina to meet them and try to build a relationship and then
they didn't even showed Jordan's face in the movie which actually was pretty cool it was basically the whole relationship was how do I impress his mom because I
