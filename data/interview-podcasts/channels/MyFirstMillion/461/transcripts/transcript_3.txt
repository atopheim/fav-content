have two percent even a margin and that's the adjusted ebitda the rule they actually burn 10 million but the the
adjusted is that they you know they they made a a small two percent uh margin and
so super Capital intensive they raised like 200 something million dollars before going public and they didn't
going public another to 300 million dollars went into the business I think and so it's taken them
a lot of capital to get here so I would say three things Amazing Story just in general like props
to them for pulling this off like they built this out of an incubator I ran an incubator for six years and couldn't get one thing to even 10 million in revenue
and they this was like a big hit that came out of a a incubator which is very very rare
Roman which now rebranded wrote also came out of an incubator at the same time so they're the two biggest
incubator hits were sort of the these two companies that did the same thing essentially one did it for hair so I
think uh hymns did it for hair hair loss and Road did it for Ed and then they both just added the other product as
they went um so impressive in that way the revenue growth impressive the ad spend and the
money burned incredible I now question is this even a good business so like they basically showed that their
their CAC so their cost to acquire customers uh is really high like their
cost to acquire customers is basically what do I have it here it's like 100 plus dollars to acquire a customer let
me grab it um I think it's like 150 on average to to acquire a customer the lowest it's
been is like a hundred dollars to acquire a customer and um they basically think they think they
3x their money in three years which is actually not very good for Ecom like my
Ecom business which is nowhere near the scale of this is way more efficient than this like they're trying to pay back essentially
you know a little over a year uh you know we're trying to pay back in in two months and so like you know it's amazing
what just pure aggression uh they approach this business with they were just like yeah we're gonna scale this
thing and we're gonna pour a bunch of money in we're gonna burn a bunch of money but we're gonna ramp up and like we're gonna try to thread the needle to
get this business to work when it's at the billions in in scale and um they kind of pulled it off because they went
public with vs back and they got liquid before the business really worked this week I had to chop down a tree at my
farm and I didn't have an ax so I just used a sledgehammer instead and so my wife was like oh do you you chopped down
that tree I was like I I gotta smashed it down and uh I just sludged him
hammered it down and that's kind of what these guys did they just kind of sledgehammered their way into into the
market have you seen this guy that's on Tick Tock that just chops the tree and all like it gets like a million views and
it's all there's like hundreds of thousands of women commenting like like just like gasp like I need him yeah
shirtless no is he shirtless and hot is he shirtless and he just chops the tree perfectly like it's like it takes them
like 10 Strokes to crack down this giant tree is that like a innuendo for sex or
something literally like I'm watching this thing and I'm like I don't even know why I'm watching this this is like just
from a purely objective level this is very attractive I'm just gonna say this this is hat
he just wears like suspenders he looks like a lumberjack but he's like gq'd out so he's he's like a groomed
lumberjack that's super like with a CrossFit body that chops down trees instead of going to the gym since he's
incredible so um you're kind of like that you're like that but like you know
[Laughter]
so that's basically what these guys did they kind of brute force their way but why don't you think this is a good
business well I think that the I mean just the amount of capital it took to get to this
business value so it's worth 1.8 billion on paper um and they've taken 500 million to get
here so like if you just zoom out it's like we three and a half extra money like
that's not the most impressive thing but like when you frame it the other way which is like we're gonna hit a billion dollars in sales and we've done this in
seven years and like you know we've built the largest telemedicine Health company for men and women and you could
frame it one way or you could just kind of look at another it's like now here's a business where if I have to pay 150 to acquire a customer and give takes two
years to pay it back if if that we'll see how it all projects out it's super sensitive to like you know they pour so
much money into marketing and what if you know Facebook costs change like you know How's that gonna affect them like there's all these factors I'm not saying
it's a bad business but like compared to that pedex company that does 100 million in sales and dividends
out 50 million to the owner I know which business I would want to own right uh the business that didn't
need us back to to succeed as the business I would want to own the one that's dividending
out like a mega yacht every year to this guy like that's sick and it has like you know one one millionth of the notoriety
of a brand like it some others you say about the uh yeah tell me the the other interesting so so other cool things so
so there's some notable things for the research I want to put these on the screen so I put the put the images on screen on YouTube if you're listening to
the podcast just pause go to YouTube because you got to see these so if you go back through their history uh first
take a look at this thing I have on page uh what is this page like three or something of this the p l do you see
this p l um this was in their S1 to go public
it's literally it just says Revenue 27. gross profit eight adjusted Ebina
minus 68. that's the p l they shared in their investor presentation I was like what kind of
a kindergarten level of detail is this what kind of crayon p l are you doing
like this is [ __ ] ridiculous and I was like this is why spax this is why spax went to [ __ ] because it's like half
the p l is just projections what you can't do if you go public the traditional way but in spax you can do these like forward-looking projections
and that's how all these guys got away with it it's like we got a shitty business now but like five years from now we're crushing and that's like you
know they were able to tell that story whereas you can't make forward-looking statements in the traditional way of going public
and then I was like this is some absolute basic beginner looking thing I I was just stunned that this this is
like on the SEC website that's a that's an embarrassment uh all right second thing you can go to their website
and you can find in the web archive their landing page from the beginning so check this out this was their first landing page this is like the month that
they launched it just said guy against staggering odds two things happen one
the universe two you you let's walk at our full height honor our forebearers
have a smile and for God's sakes floss shop now and it just go it just Scrolls down and it just says sex this is this
is simple you need erections when you want them and not when it's convenient for your penis and there's an eggplant Emoji it says shop sex and there was
another one for hair like that was like the same it was like she needs to run her fingers through your hair a lot and then it just says our best sellers and
there's just a very basic bottle that says finasteride and that's like the the
generic name for Propecia or like you know for like the hair uh male pattern
baldness like drug or whatever and they were just selling it for 28 and then there was they only had two skews finasteride and vitamins not even like
vitamin C this is yes but here's some vitamins and so incredible to go see I
