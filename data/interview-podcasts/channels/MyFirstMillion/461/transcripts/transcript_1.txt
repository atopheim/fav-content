who was the CMO and Kip joined HubSpot in year five I asked Kip how big do you
think HubSpot could be when he joined you know how big did he think so HubSpot today is worth 25 billion dollars when I
asked him he said I thought he could hit a billion dollars in valuation there's a little bit of a stretch but I thought we
could do a billion dollars uh in valuation meaning like what's that 80 million in Revenue I
don't know how that's something like that and then I asked darmesh I go how big do you think he could get he goes
really I didn't have any idea but I knew that all I wanted was a thousand customers who would each pay 250 which
by the way this is only three million dollars a year in revenue and I thought that would be a pretty cool Milestone and so the reason isn't all we or the
outcome isn't always clear of is this worth it now the reason this is important is because the biggest pain in
business is not just failing but it's failing slowly and spending like a decade working on something and wasting
your the most non-renewable resource there is time wasting that time and I
mean it's significantly worse I think than losing millions of dollars a year in one or two years and then quitting and so that's where the it's kind of an
art it's a skill it's an intuition it's Talent that's where all this stuff comes into place so tactically what does this
mean Ben Franklin said a small leak will stake a great ship Warren Buffett said
so you find yourself in a chronically leaky boat energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive
than energy devoted to patching leaks so the point being only work on [ __ ] as
long as your boat ain't leaking as long as you don't got any holes in that boat but here's the thing every early Safe
Company yeah everything's leaky at first so I went back to darmesh and back to kit and I go guys tell me about this
HubSpot right now your guys's net revenue retention I don't know what it is exactly but I think it's like a hundred and five percent meaning for
every dollar that someone spends at HubSpot now the next year they're gonna spend a dollar and five cents and he
said uh and Chip and uh Kip they said a few things so I'm gonna mix it up a little bit but uh or I'm gonna kind of
interchange with what they said but I believe it was Kip who said our churn at first was terrible it was beyond bad at
one point we were losing 30 percent of customers on an annual base on an annual basis I then asked uh darmesh I go was
your guys's churn really that bad he goes yeah it was definitely really bad it took about five years in order to
like get it to where it was a good place and I said well what did you do to fix that and he said our goal was not to
make customers happy was to make happy customers meaning everything from our branding pitch Marketing sales service
everything should be thought out in a process where the outcome was a happy customer and that meant it was everyone's job marketing needs to be
reaching better fit customers who are less likely to churn sales needed not sales shouldn't oversell and make sure
they only qualify that these customers will likely succeed which helps reduce the churn products needs to make sure
they don't just build new features but build a feature that reduces insurance and they have to make these features make sure these features get adopted and
churn is churn reduction is a team sport you also have to remember there's a power law which is 90 of stickiness will
be driven by 10 of the product and Company features and not to add 100 features and instead just find ones that
work and double down on those so the point being All Ships are leaky at first but
hopefully you can figure out a way to do it and last but not least my takeaway ten dollars a month it's rarely gonna
feed a bunch of hungry mouths so our listeners including you and I sometimes I do this as well I had a 25 a month
product a lot of times what we do is we look for arbitrages or we look for like small
little hacks that's neat that's all cool and all every once in a while it gives you that dopamine hit but this company
the reason I like it is you know how much they charge per year 300 000 a year for a license to their company they only
have 450 clients and Andrew in his sub stack article he said something great he goes imagine
you're running an oil rig that extracts hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil per day Brent crude is currently uh
crude is currently trading at 75 per barrel so every 100 Barrel is 75 7 500 in Revenue your it guy comes up to you
and says boss attacks just raise their prices by 10 I think we could save three thousand
dollars annually if we switch software providers to another thorough Dynamic fluid characterization package instead
you tell them to piss off don't touch a thing just make sure nothing breaks it means like three thousand dollars there's nothing in the grand scheme of a
huge Capital intense business so they put their price up 10 and everyone moves moves on and goes on before because look
it helps them solve their business so or it helps them solve problems in their business it makes your business better so this is my breakdown of this company
I love it I love this company I love these Scottish guys Jonathan's
giving me a clap what do you think about this one yeah Jonathan you like that one oh yeah
that was you you kind of touched it all you got the opening story hit with the impact and then the three big takeaways
at the end and that like q a with Kiff and darmesh was a nice touch yeah that was a good touch I like how you brought
that in the um there was a a bit of a spelling and
pronunciation challenge at the beginning but you overcame that and I'm proud of you for doing that you know what I say I
so I went to speech class when I was a kid by the way and I always used to tell people I just got a big tongue my tongue's real thick I got a thick tongue
it's something I'm big tongued yeah I got I got fat Thug a pet see I give it a
fat tongue it's like a it's like a it's like a snail in there it's like a slug I got a slug of a tongue I got molasses in
my mouth I don't know what to say it's hard for me to say some words sometimes it's like the further away from St Louis
a person gets or a company gets like the harder it is to explain them
um that's interesting you know I I guess two days on mine right now I bet there's opportunity to create like
another pedex basically which is uh with machine learning and AI
you could go into these kind of like Old School Big dollar type companies and
be like hey look we have the ability to process your data or to give you insights that's going to save you money
like yeah 10 efficiency gain 20 efficiency gains and I bet that these opportunities you know have existed but
the the more powerful mlna I get the more those opportunities open up and the
bottleneck is people who even understand what problems exist inside of uh you know some Shale gas company or inside of
Exxon Mobil and then being able to go sell into them there was a guy who I met very early on when I was doing my
startup I didn't really know any other entrepreneurs but there's one guy who also went to Duke and I wonder what happened to him I
haven't kept in touch but I think his name was Evan Anderson and he was building a company that was
um selling to I was called osberg yeah this is exactly right let's see what happened with this company
um so it was selling to um companies that were in Oklahoma so I
was like well you moved to Oklahoma and he was like yeah this is what our customers are and I was like who's your
customers and it was like all the oil and gas companies that uh that are in America and what he was doing at that
time was basically quote-unquote Big Data uh big data for oil and gas and I
was like that's a great idea I'm looking at it now he's still there CEO 14 years later so I've got this company's been
