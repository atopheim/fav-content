been pretty successful and I was like I would check in with him and be like you know what's the challenge and at this time I'm working on a sushi restaurant
chain and he's like you know I'll spend six months just courting the right guy
the right suit at this uh at this company I gotta take him to uh you know a football game I gotta invite his
family over we got to get to know him we got to get him comfortable with this uh you know the software but once I get
once I close that deal these deals are going to be worth millions and millions of dollars over time they're never going to rip us out
once we get in and so um I I'm curious how this company is doing today but I
know that you know 15 years ago I was like this is a great idea and I just I I
intuitively knew it because I was like the same effort it's taking me to do
this silly sushi restaurant thing he's spending the same amount of time he's just working for a much bigger prize
with much more defensibility and a much clearer value where he's going into an industry that's like never had uh you
know doesn't have this this sort of software capability he's like I will sit here until I understand your problems
and then I will build solutions for this and I just love that approach I think that's a like if people are willing to
kind of like eat [ __ ] and go outside of their like kind of comfort zone of problem areas they understand there's
pretty big opportunities yeah and it's cool did you see this graph from Andrew Lynch of this
company's Revenue yeah it's just like a perfect hockey stick but over a long period of time over a really long period
of time I mean that's something you want to talk about like this 15 years to get to 10 million you know respect for continuing and
making it all work that's not for me what's the boys quote uh why is everyone make fun of getting
rich quick it's the best way to get rich and I'm going to tell you about a company in a second here that said in
their first week they did a million dollars of sales and never went less than that from there and you think that that's not true correct I think it's I
think it's a lie but I love a good lie I love a good life tell me about this give
me a good underestimate how much of uh startup stories are just lies okay so here's my here's my big business
breakdown I see your duel and I uh I raise you um In My Head by the way we were doing
an old-fashioned Western duel but now I decided it's American Gladiators and your laser non-blazer and we're going at
it on the chest but so this morning I was thinking about
who's lying out there who's lying men's problems that way okay so most people have heard
apparently you got a little you got a little situation is that the issue no no no that's not how we got actually
here's the here's the actual train of thought I was thinking about um these T-Shirt Company a little segue
here to tell you how my brain works so the thing about these t-shirt companies I don't know if you've seen this but basically in the last kind of like four
years there's been a bunch of companies start started that succeeded that did the most
obvious thing and I've seen this happen again and again that there's these windows of time
where Big Ideas are just hidden in plain sight and so basically in the last four years
a bunch of companies have started to do such a simple thing they just sell basic
plain men's t-shirts and these were the Big d2c Ideas so like anybody who wanted
to do e-commerce or Drop Shipping or d2c build a brand the opportunity was sitting right in
front of everybody it was just men's t-shirts so you have Cuts fresh clean
tees true classic tees built Basics all of these companies that in the last sort of four year window have built 100
million dollar plus companies so some of them do about 50 million a year in sales some of them do 100 or 150 million
dollars a year in sales so this kind of range but to go in like a three year period to get to 150 million in sales
that's what true classic tees did is just bananas to be honest and so
um I'll tell you the uh the numbers for True classic so year one uh let's see
where the video so I think go okay you're one 15 million you're two 90 million you're three 150 million in top
line revenue and um and they did it all through Facebook ads selling plain you
know white black blue men's t-shirts and that's the same thing I think fresh
clean teas is somewhere like 50 million north of 50 million in Revenue uh I think Cuts is over 100 million
um it's crazy that these companies all scaled so fast doing this such an
obvious thing where is the there was no massive Innovation and so I was thinking about this I was like man there's these
windows of time and then I thought about what what are other windows that I've seen like this and I stayed in the e-commerce world and I thought about oh
back in 2017 both Roman and hymns launched doing basically the same thing
and they launched within like a couple months of each other basically people had the same idea at the same time and
both of them became Billion Dollar Plus companies doing the same thing what they did was you know I guess the summary is
they took advantage of a uh what do we call it an inflection uh Sam blows this
regulation inflection in this case well this was a regulation inflection this is a regulatory inflection and so what
happened was um there was proven market demand for drugs like Viagra uh or Propecia or
Rogaine and so hair loss or erectile dysfunction there was a proven like business there and they started like in
the early 90s and so by 2017 the patents expired for those and when the patents
expired have you ever taken a Viagra or anything like that haven't have you no but if someone if
someone told me it's awesome I would but I've never thought it's awesome go
so so the patents expired and basically now there was like generic versions of these and so what and at the same time
there's another regulatory inflection which was that telemedicine was becoming more and more things were getting opened up for telemedicine meaning you could
prescribe drugs without going to the doctor so drugs without a doctor was the key kind of like just you know frame uh
framework for for this type of business and so they both launch and the hymns guy says this guy Andrew uh dude him he
goes we launched and in our first week we did a million dollars of sales and
we've never done less than a million since then I was like wow that is incredible and it is true that him
scaled really quickly so their revenue a week so he said they never did he said they never did less than a million a
week after watching yes oh is that and I was like that's insane I was thinking
about that because I was like I've launched many things the first week is you're talking about patching holes on a
boat that's how the first week is it's like you don't even have inventory you don't have you don't have a million dollars of inventory you don't have like
to do a million dollars how much are you spending an ad did you just blast like half a million dollars of ads in your
first week Facebook ads doesn't even let you ramp up that quickly so I was a little bit suspicious of this and uh the
revenue did ramp quickly so they launched the very end of 2017 2018 the
full year they did 27 million dollars in Revenue with 27 million dollars in ad spend so they spent 100 of Revenue on
ads so they burned a bunch of money uh 2019 they did they went from 27 million to 83 million and they spent 50 million
on ads 2020 they were forecasting about 140 million and then I have the actual so check out this Revenue girl it's
pretty insane 2021 they did 270. 2022 they did 540. 2023 they're projecting to
finish at 800 million in Revenue so this is a pretty crazy run in uh what six
years to ramp up to 800 million and and revenue so they can get a billion in
Revenue in seven years exactly they're burning money this whole time even now even at 500 million last year they only
