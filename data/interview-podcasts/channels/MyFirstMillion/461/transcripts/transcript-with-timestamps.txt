0:00
I'm gonna blow your mind ready so Scotland you know Scotland you've heard of that country Scotland right
0:05
you've heard of that place familiar land of kilts and sheeps but also redheads
0:11
but okay and redheads but it's also home to one of the coolest SAS businesses that I've ever heard of so it's called
0:16
petroleum exports uh they it's known as uh pet tax [Music]
0:29
let's jump in we got a bunch of stuff today we're gonna do what's called a business breakdown duel
0:36
Sean and I you know is that a western duel I guess is uh we
0:43
both did a business breakdown and we didn't know that the other one was gonna do it and so now we're gonna compare I'm
0:49
gonna go first which gives you the advantage because the person who goes last always usually wins in rap battles
0:56
because that's it's always like when you you know like when I do you know when they do the Applause or like person a
1:01
person B if person B always wins I get to hear you say your thing and
1:08
then I can make fun of what you said yeah so anyway you're gonna you get the advantage but that's okay so I'll go
1:15
first okay but before I go first I've got to give a shout out to Andrew Lynch from net income um it's a sub stack it's where I
1:22
I found uh this particular business and I'm just and I'm stealing uh a lot of his numbers but
1:28
I'm gonna blow your mind ready so Scotland you know Scotland you've heard of that country Scotland right
1:33
you've heard of that place familiar land of kilts and sheeps but also I think
1:39
they're sheeps there I don't actually know that's how little I know about Scotland but also redheads but okay and
1:45
redheads but it's also home to one of the coolest SAS businesses that I've ever heard of so it's called petroleum
1:50
exports uh they it's known as uh pet tax pad tax it's a challenging name I know
1:56
and it's a highly technical specialist software crucial for oil and gas operations you can go to
2:04
p-e-t-e-x.com to check it out so pull that up but pet pet tax it's a highly
2:09
technical specialist software that's the backbone of some of the most important operations in the oil and gas industry
2:16
and it sounds boring and that's because it is however they last year they made 78 million
2:22
pounds in Revenue which is about 100 million dollars USD and on that 100
2:27
million dollars in Revenue about 67 million of it was profit and of that of
2:34
that profit they basically took out all the money so they paid a dividend of 41 million pounds which is about 60 million
2:41
dollars and that was paid to the owner and it wasn't even retained to the company which means for every dollar they took about 52 dollars went directly
2:48
to the or 52 cents went directly to the owner's pocket now
2:54
here's the cool part none of this is rumors this isn't hearsay I'm not like telling you I heard a story because in
3:00
the UK If you're a privately held company that hits a certain threshold in Revenue you have to submit your reports
3:06
and you could just log in it's called company's house you can just go there and you can log in you can see all this information and so I went and looked at
3:12
many many many years of their data and I'm going to tell you a story about how this company came to be so it was
3:18
started by this guy name we're gonna call him Aid his name's Abe his name he's he's a Muslim guy very very very
3:24
challenging uh first and last name can you see his name can you tell me how to pronounce that do you know how to pronounce that
3:32
is the first name and the last name it's very challenging there's a d and there's a j together that's a very challenging
3:37
okay so you are calling him ape or he goes by Abe I'm calling him Abe his last name is if you look at it if it meant
3:44
many Muslim AES but uh we're gonna call him his last name has a d and a j next to each other I don't even know how to
3:50
pronounce that sound so I'm sorry it's a very challenging name to
3:56
pronounce so he started the company in 1990 it was based in Al Aberdeen
4:02
Scotland which is basically like a hub for oil industry it's kind of like similar to what Houston in America is
4:08
and the company originally served as a petroleum consultant for in uh Consultants to the control petroleum
4:15
industry as well as retailers and they would create these mathematical models to help uh people in the in the oil and
4:21
gas industry manage their projects and so today they've kind of pivoted from
4:26
Consulting to providing software they only have 420 customers and their core product is composed of complex products
4:33
which are complex features that with descriptions like a multi-phase network modeling and optimization and thorough
4:40
Dynamics fluid characterization package so pretty complicated stuff so as I said they started as a Consulting business
4:47
and they did have done 78 million pounds in Revenue last year which is about 100 million USD 58 million USD in profit and
4:56
50 million in dividends meaning the company doesn't require much capital x so they made all this profit in most all
5:03
of it 58 million profit 50 million came out of the business and went directly to the owner's pockets and he's been doing
5:09
this for years and years and years their business biggest expense is employees so
5:14
because they're based in the UK they pay UK software engineer salaries which are lower than the US making their average
5:19
all-in cost per each employee of which they have 86 of them only a hundred and one thousand pounds per year so the
5:27
which means that they are doing 911 pounds 900 911 000 pounds in Revenue per
5:34
employee so 9x 9x basically Roi per person that they hired so yeah this
5:42
company absolutely kills it and I want to tell you when I was analyzing this company and um if you look up Andrew
5:48
Lynch his sub stack he does a really good job of explaining the technical details of the company I want to explain
5:53
some of the entrepreneurial takeaways that I had so if you go to the top uh link Sean in our doc
6:00
um or at the beginning of the story you'll see the sub stack where you can it's his Andrew Lynch has a thing called
6:05
net income and that's where I discovered this so I want to tell you some of my takeaways takeaway one Focus plus time
6:13
that's what this guy did so everyone talks about Focus but what does Focus means you basically in my opinion need
6:18
to focus enough to turn your idea into a machine and then after that I think you can deviate some attention away from
6:24
that if you want but the company needs focus and that Focus took takes time so I went back and I looked at a lot of
6:30
their uh revenue and so did Andrew so if you scroll down Sean you'll see a graph
6:35
of the revenue and what you'll notice is that it took them 15 years to get to 10
6:40
million dollars in Revenue 10 million pounds I'm going to call it dollars so 10 million dollars in revenue and I know
6:46
a lot of people I think maybe you have done this with one of your businesses got to close to 10 million Revenue in like 1.5 or one or two years actually
6:53
and so 15 years particularly in like the tech Internet space
6:58
it feels horribly long but I think that's okay that's the right feeling and so what I try to do something I've been
7:04
thinking about for a while is I ask myself in 10 or 20 years will I be happy if I started this today and that's a
7:10
really good quote but that answer is incredibly murky more
7:16
often than not sometimes it's like a I think yes it's a very murky thing and there's this famous story about Jeff
7:21
Bezos when he started Amazon he has this thing called the regret minimalization framework where he says this story about
7:27
he's like well even though he had this good job I decided to start Amazon because in 80 years when I meet or when I'm 80 years old will I be proud that I
7:33
started it today the answer was yes but in that same story he also said that he
7:39
thought at most Amazon could make is a hundred million dollars a year so he he's not like he had the full picture so
7:45
it was like yeah I think this can work and so I went and talked to darmesh who's the founder of dharmesha the founder of HubSpot I also talked to Kip
7:51
who was the CMO and Kip joined HubSpot in year five I asked Kip how big do you
7:57
think HubSpot could be when he joined you know how big did he think so HubSpot today is worth 25 billion dollars when I
8:03
asked him he said I thought he could hit a billion dollars in valuation there's a little bit of a stretch but I thought we
8:08
could do a billion dollars uh in valuation meaning like what's that 80 million in Revenue I
8:15
don't know how that's something like that and then I asked darmesh I go how big do you think he could get he goes
8:20
really I didn't have any idea but I knew that all I wanted was a thousand customers who would each pay 250 which
8:26
by the way this is only three million dollars a year in revenue and I thought that would be a pretty cool Milestone and so the reason isn't all we or the
8:33
outcome isn't always clear of is this worth it now the reason this is important is because the biggest pain in
8:39
business is not just failing but it's failing slowly and spending like a decade working on something and wasting
8:44
your the most non-renewable resource there is time wasting that time and I
8:49
mean it's significantly worse I think than losing millions of dollars a year in one or two years and then quitting and so that's where the it's kind of an
8:55
art it's a skill it's an intuition it's Talent that's where all this stuff comes into place so tactically what does this
9:00
mean Ben Franklin said a small leak will stake a great ship Warren Buffett said
9:06
so you find yourself in a chronically leaky boat energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive
9:12
than energy devoted to patching leaks so the point being only work on [ __ ] as
9:19
long as your boat ain't leaking as long as you don't got any holes in that boat but here's the thing every early Safe
9:24
Company yeah everything's leaky at first so I went back to darmesh and back to kit and I go guys tell me about this
9:30
HubSpot right now your guys's net revenue retention I don't know what it is exactly but I think it's like a hundred and five percent meaning for
9:36
every dollar that someone spends at HubSpot now the next year they're gonna spend a dollar and five cents and he
9:42
said uh and Chip and uh Kip they said a few things so I'm gonna mix it up a little bit but uh or I'm gonna kind of
9:47
interchange with what they said but I believe it was Kip who said our churn at first was terrible it was beyond bad at
9:54
one point we were losing 30 percent of customers on an annual base on an annual basis I then asked uh darmesh I go was
10:02
your guys's churn really that bad he goes yeah it was definitely really bad it took about five years in order to
10:08
like get it to where it was a good place and I said well what did you do to fix that and he said our goal was not to
10:13
make customers happy was to make happy customers meaning everything from our branding pitch Marketing sales service
10:18
everything should be thought out in a process where the outcome was a happy customer and that meant it was everyone's job marketing needs to be
10:25
reaching better fit customers who are less likely to churn sales needed not sales shouldn't oversell and make sure
10:31
they only qualify that these customers will likely succeed which helps reduce the churn products needs to make sure
10:37
they don't just build new features but build a feature that reduces insurance and they have to make these features make sure these features get adopted and
10:43
churn is churn reduction is a team sport you also have to remember there's a power law which is 90 of stickiness will
10:49
be driven by 10 of the product and Company features and not to add 100 features and instead just find ones that
10:56
work and double down on those so the point being All Ships are leaky at first but
11:01
hopefully you can figure out a way to do it and last but not least my takeaway ten dollars a month it's rarely gonna
11:09
feed a bunch of hungry mouths so our listeners including you and I sometimes I do this as well I had a 25 a month
11:16
product a lot of times what we do is we look for arbitrages or we look for like small
11:21
little hacks that's neat that's all cool and all every once in a while it gives you that dopamine hit but this company
11:27
the reason I like it is you know how much they charge per year 300 000 a year for a license to their company they only
11:33
have 450 clients and Andrew in his sub stack article he said something great he goes imagine
11:38
you're running an oil rig that extracts hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil per day Brent crude is currently uh
11:45
crude is currently trading at 75 per barrel so every 100 Barrel is 75 7 500 in Revenue your it guy comes up to you
11:52
and says boss attacks just raise their prices by 10 I think we could save three thousand
11:57
dollars annually if we switch software providers to another thorough Dynamic fluid characterization package instead
12:04
you tell them to piss off don't touch a thing just make sure nothing breaks it means like three thousand dollars there's nothing in the grand scheme of a
12:10
huge Capital intense business so they put their price up 10 and everyone moves moves on and goes on before because look
12:16
it helps them solve their business so or it helps them solve problems in their business it makes your business better so this is my breakdown of this company
12:23
I love it I love this company I love these Scottish guys Jonathan's
12:29
giving me a clap what do you think about this one yeah Jonathan you like that one oh yeah
12:34
that was you you kind of touched it all you got the opening story hit with the impact and then the three big takeaways
12:40
at the end and that like q a with Kiff and darmesh was a nice touch yeah that was a good touch I like how you brought
12:45
that in the um there was a a bit of a spelling and
12:50
pronunciation challenge at the beginning but you overcame that and I'm proud of you for doing that you know what I say I
12:56
so I went to speech class when I was a kid by the way and I always used to tell people I just got a big tongue my tongue's real thick I got a thick tongue
13:03
it's something I'm big tongued yeah I got I got fat Thug a pet see I give it a
13:08
fat tongue it's like a it's like a it's like a snail in there it's like a slug I got a slug of a tongue I got molasses in
13:15
my mouth I don't know what to say it's hard for me to say some words sometimes it's like the further away from St Louis
13:20
a person gets or a company gets like the harder it is to explain them
13:27
um that's interesting you know I I guess two days on mine right now I bet there's opportunity to create like
13:33
another pedex basically which is uh with machine learning and AI
13:39
you could go into these kind of like Old School Big dollar type companies and
13:44
be like hey look we have the ability to process your data or to give you insights that's going to save you money
13:50
like yeah 10 efficiency gain 20 efficiency gains and I bet that these opportunities you know have existed but
13:56
the the more powerful mlna I get the more those opportunities open up and the
14:01
bottleneck is people who even understand what problems exist inside of uh you know some Shale gas company or inside of
14:08
Exxon Mobil and then being able to go sell into them there was a guy who I met very early on when I was doing my
14:14
startup I didn't really know any other entrepreneurs but there's one guy who also went to Duke and I wonder what happened to him I
14:19
haven't kept in touch but I think his name was Evan Anderson and he was building a company that was
14:26
um selling to I was called osberg yeah this is exactly right let's see what happened with this company
14:32
um so it was selling to um companies that were in Oklahoma so I
14:37
was like well you moved to Oklahoma and he was like yeah this is what our customers are and I was like who's your
14:43
customers and it was like all the oil and gas companies that uh that are in America and what he was doing at that
14:49
time was basically quote-unquote Big Data uh big data for oil and gas and I
14:54
was like that's a great idea I'm looking at it now he's still there CEO 14 years later so I've got this company's been
15:00
been pretty successful and I was like I would check in with him and be like you know what's the challenge and at this time I'm working on a sushi restaurant
15:06
chain and he's like you know I'll spend six months just courting the right guy
15:12
the right suit at this uh at this company I gotta take him to uh you know a football game I gotta invite his
15:19
family over we got to get to know him we got to get him comfortable with this uh you know the software but once I get
15:24
once I close that deal these deals are going to be worth millions and millions of dollars over time they're never going to rip us out
15:30
once we get in and so um I I'm curious how this company is doing today but I
15:36
know that you know 15 years ago I was like this is a great idea and I just I I
15:42
intuitively knew it because I was like the same effort it's taking me to do
15:47
this silly sushi restaurant thing he's spending the same amount of time he's just working for a much bigger prize
15:53
with much more defensibility and a much clearer value where he's going into an industry that's like never had uh you
16:00
know doesn't have this this sort of software capability he's like I will sit here until I understand your problems
16:06
and then I will build solutions for this and I just love that approach I think that's a like if people are willing to
16:12
kind of like eat [ __ ] and go outside of their like kind of comfort zone of problem areas they understand there's
16:17
pretty big opportunities yeah and it's cool did you see this graph from Andrew Lynch of this
16:23
company's Revenue yeah it's just like a perfect hockey stick but over a long period of time over a really long period
16:29
of time I mean that's something you want to talk about like this 15 years to get to 10 million you know respect for continuing and
16:35
making it all work that's not for me what's the boys quote uh why is everyone make fun of getting
16:42
rich quick it's the best way to get rich and I'm going to tell you about a company in a second here that said in
16:49
their first week they did a million dollars of sales and never went less than that from there and you think that that's not true correct I think it's I
16:56
think it's a lie but I love a good lie I love a good life tell me about this give
17:01
me a good underestimate how much of uh startup stories are just lies okay so here's my here's my big business
17:08
breakdown I see your duel and I uh I raise you um In My Head by the way we were doing
17:14
an old-fashioned Western duel but now I decided it's American Gladiators and your laser non-blazer and we're going at
17:19
it on the chest but so this morning I was thinking about
17:25
who's lying out there who's lying men's problems that way okay so most people have heard
17:33
apparently you got a little you got a little situation is that the issue no no no that's not how we got actually
17:41
here's the here's the actual train of thought I was thinking about um these T-Shirt Company a little segue
17:46
here to tell you how my brain works so the thing about these t-shirt companies I don't know if you've seen this but basically in the last kind of like four
17:53
years there's been a bunch of companies start started that succeeded that did the most
17:58
obvious thing and I've seen this happen again and again that there's these windows of time
18:04
where Big Ideas are just hidden in plain sight and so basically in the last four years
18:09
a bunch of companies have started to do such a simple thing they just sell basic
18:14
plain men's t-shirts and these were the Big d2c Ideas so like anybody who wanted
18:20
to do e-commerce or Drop Shipping or d2c build a brand the opportunity was sitting right in
18:26
front of everybody it was just men's t-shirts so you have Cuts fresh clean
18:31
tees true classic tees built Basics all of these companies that in the last sort of four year window have built 100
18:39
million dollar plus companies so some of them do about 50 million a year in sales some of them do 100 or 150 million
18:44
dollars a year in sales so this kind of range but to go in like a three year period to get to 150 million in sales
18:51
that's what true classic tees did is just bananas to be honest and so
18:57
um I'll tell you the uh the numbers for True classic so year one uh let's see
19:03
where the video so I think go okay you're one 15 million you're two 90 million you're three 150 million in top
19:10
line revenue and um and they did it all through Facebook ads selling plain you
19:16
know white black blue men's t-shirts and that's the same thing I think fresh
19:21
clean teas is somewhere like 50 million north of 50 million in Revenue uh I think Cuts is over 100 million
19:28
um it's crazy that these companies all scaled so fast doing this such an
19:33
obvious thing where is the there was no massive Innovation and so I was thinking about this I was like man there's these
19:39
windows of time and then I thought about what what are other windows that I've seen like this and I stayed in the e-commerce world and I thought about oh
19:45
back in 2017 both Roman and hymns launched doing basically the same thing
19:51
and they launched within like a couple months of each other basically people had the same idea at the same time and
19:56
both of them became Billion Dollar Plus companies doing the same thing what they did was you know I guess the summary is
20:03
they took advantage of a uh what do we call it an inflection uh Sam blows this
20:09
regulation inflection in this case well this was a regulation inflection this is a regulatory inflection and so what
20:15
happened was um there was proven market demand for drugs like Viagra uh or Propecia or
20:21
Rogaine and so hair loss or erectile dysfunction there was a proven like business there and they started like in
20:28
the early 90s and so by 2017 the patents expired for those and when the patents
20:33
expired have you ever taken a Viagra or anything like that haven't have you no but if someone if
20:40
someone told me it's awesome I would but I've never thought it's awesome go
20:47
so so the patents expired and basically now there was like generic versions of these and so what and at the same time
20:54
there's another regulatory inflection which was that telemedicine was becoming more and more things were getting opened up for telemedicine meaning you could
21:01
prescribe drugs without going to the doctor so drugs without a doctor was the key kind of like just you know frame uh
21:08
framework for for this type of business and so they both launch and the hymns guy says this guy Andrew uh dude him he
21:15
goes we launched and in our first week we did a million dollars of sales and
21:20
we've never done less than a million since then I was like wow that is incredible and it is true that him
21:26
scaled really quickly so their revenue a week so he said they never did he said they never did less than a million a
21:32
week after watching yes oh is that and I was like that's insane I was thinking
21:38
about that because I was like I've launched many things the first week is you're talking about patching holes on a
21:44
boat that's how the first week is it's like you don't even have inventory you don't have you don't have a million dollars of inventory you don't have like
21:50
to do a million dollars how much are you spending an ad did you just blast like half a million dollars of ads in your
21:57
first week Facebook ads doesn't even let you ramp up that quickly so I was a little bit suspicious of this and uh the
22:03
revenue did ramp quickly so they launched the very end of 2017 2018 the
22:08
full year they did 27 million dollars in Revenue with 27 million dollars in ad spend so they spent 100 of Revenue on
22:15
ads so they burned a bunch of money uh 2019 they did they went from 27 million to 83 million and they spent 50 million
22:22
on ads 2020 they were forecasting about 140 million and then I have the actual so check out this Revenue girl it's
22:28
pretty insane 2021 they did 270. 2022 they did 540. 2023 they're projecting to
22:34
finish at 800 million in Revenue so this is a pretty crazy run in uh what six
22:40
years to ramp up to 800 million and and revenue so they can get a billion in
22:45
Revenue in seven years exactly they're burning money this whole time even now even at 500 million last year they only
22:52
have two percent even a margin and that's the adjusted ebitda the rule they actually burn 10 million but the the
22:57
adjusted is that they you know they they made a a small two percent uh margin and
23:03
so super Capital intensive they raised like 200 something million dollars before going public and they didn't
23:08
going public another to 300 million dollars went into the business I think and so it's taken them
23:14
a lot of capital to get here so I would say three things Amazing Story just in general like props
23:20
to them for pulling this off like they built this out of an incubator I ran an incubator for six years and couldn't get one thing to even 10 million in revenue
23:27
and they this was like a big hit that came out of a a incubator which is very very rare
23:33
Roman which now rebranded wrote also came out of an incubator at the same time so they're the two biggest
23:38
incubator hits were sort of the these two companies that did the same thing essentially one did it for hair so I
23:45
think uh hymns did it for hair hair loss and Road did it for Ed and then they both just added the other product as
23:51
they went um so impressive in that way the revenue growth impressive the ad spend and the
23:57
money burned incredible I now question is this even a good business so like they basically showed that their
24:05
their CAC so their cost to acquire customers uh is really high like their
24:11
cost to acquire customers is basically what do I have it here it's like 100 plus dollars to acquire a customer let
24:17
me grab it um I think it's like 150 on average to to acquire a customer the lowest it's
24:23
been is like a hundred dollars to acquire a customer and um they basically think they think they
24:29
3x their money in three years which is actually not very good for Ecom like my
24:34
Ecom business which is nowhere near the scale of this is way more efficient than this like they're trying to pay back essentially
24:41
you know a little over a year uh you know we're trying to pay back in in two months and so like you know it's amazing
24:48
what just pure aggression uh they approach this business with they were just like yeah we're gonna scale this
24:54
thing and we're gonna pour a bunch of money in we're gonna burn a bunch of money but we're gonna ramp up and like we're gonna try to thread the needle to
25:01
get this business to work when it's at the billions in in scale and um they kind of pulled it off because they went
25:07
public with vs back and they got liquid before the business really worked this week I had to chop down a tree at my
25:13
farm and I didn't have an ax so I just used a sledgehammer instead and so my wife was like oh do you you chopped down
25:20
that tree I was like I I gotta smashed it down and uh I just sludged him
25:25
hammered it down and that's kind of what these guys did they just kind of sledgehammered their way into into the
25:30
market have you seen this guy that's on Tick Tock that just chops the tree and all like it gets like a million views and
25:37
it's all there's like hundreds of thousands of women commenting like like just like gasp like I need him yeah
25:45
shirtless no is he shirtless and hot is he shirtless and he just chops the tree perfectly like it's like it takes them
25:52
like 10 Strokes to crack down this giant tree is that like a innuendo for sex or
25:58
something literally like I'm watching this thing and I'm like I don't even know why I'm watching this this is like just
26:04
from a purely objective level this is very attractive I'm just gonna say this this is hat
26:13
he just wears like suspenders he looks like a lumberjack but he's like gq'd out so he's he's like a groomed
26:20
lumberjack that's super like with a CrossFit body that chops down trees instead of going to the gym since he's
26:25
incredible so um you're kind of like that you're like that but like you know
26:30
[Laughter]
26:41
so that's basically what these guys did they kind of brute force their way but why don't you think this is a good
26:46
business well I think that the I mean just the amount of capital it took to get to this
26:52
business value so it's worth 1.8 billion on paper um and they've taken 500 million to get
26:58
here so like if you just zoom out it's like we three and a half extra money like
27:03
that's not the most impressive thing but like when you frame it the other way which is like we're gonna hit a billion dollars in sales and we've done this in
27:10
seven years and like you know we've built the largest telemedicine Health company for men and women and you could
27:16
frame it one way or you could just kind of look at another it's like now here's a business where if I have to pay 150 to acquire a customer and give takes two
27:22
years to pay it back if if that we'll see how it all projects out it's super sensitive to like you know they pour so
27:29
much money into marketing and what if you know Facebook costs change like you know How's that gonna affect them like there's all these factors I'm not saying
27:34
it's a bad business but like compared to that pedex company that does 100 million in sales and dividends
27:41
out 50 million to the owner I know which business I would want to own right uh the business that didn't
27:47
need us back to to succeed as the business I would want to own the one that's dividending
27:53
out like a mega yacht every year to this guy like that's sick and it has like you know one one millionth of the notoriety
27:59
of a brand like it some others you say about the uh yeah tell me the the other interesting so so other cool things so
28:05
so there's some notable things for the research I want to put these on the screen so I put the put the images on screen on YouTube if you're listening to
28:11
the podcast just pause go to YouTube because you got to see these so if you go back through their history uh first
28:17
take a look at this thing I have on page uh what is this page like three or something of this the p l do you see
28:23
this p l um this was in their S1 to go public
28:28
it's literally it just says Revenue 27. gross profit eight adjusted Ebina
28:36
minus 68. that's the p l they shared in their investor presentation I was like what kind of
28:41
a kindergarten level of detail is this what kind of crayon p l are you doing
28:47
like this is [ __ ] ridiculous and I was like this is why spax this is why spax went to [ __ ] because it's like half
28:53
the p l is just projections what you can't do if you go public the traditional way but in spax you can do these like forward-looking projections
29:00
and that's how all these guys got away with it it's like we got a shitty business now but like five years from now we're crushing and that's like you
29:07
know they were able to tell that story whereas you can't make forward-looking statements in the traditional way of going public
29:12
and then I was like this is some absolute basic beginner looking thing I I was just stunned that this this is
29:19
like on the SEC website that's a that's an embarrassment uh all right second thing you can go to their website
29:25
and you can find in the web archive their landing page from the beginning so check this out this was their first landing page this is like the month that
29:31
they launched it just said guy against staggering odds two things happen one
29:36
the universe two you you let's walk at our full height honor our forebearers
29:42
have a smile and for God's sakes floss shop now and it just go it just Scrolls down and it just says sex this is this
29:50
is simple you need erections when you want them and not when it's convenient for your penis and there's an eggplant Emoji it says shop sex and there was
29:57
another one for hair like that was like the same it was like she needs to run her fingers through your hair a lot and then it just says our best sellers and
30:03
there's just a very basic bottle that says finasteride and that's like the the
30:09
generic name for Propecia or like you know for like the hair uh male pattern
30:14
baldness like drug or whatever and they were just selling it for 28 and then there was they only had two skews finasteride and vitamins not even like
30:21
vitamin C this is yes but here's some vitamins and so incredible to go see I
30:28
love love love looking at successful businesses early landing pages just to see like how did they get their business
30:34
out the door one thing that's interesting is from the beginning they actually had a pretty strong like branding and brand identity so if you go
30:40
do this with like Snapchat or Uber the first websites are just absolutely fugly like um I have this blog post on the
30:47
internet that's called like you just search Sean Prairie uh early startup
30:52
landing pages medium um 10th okay it's called 10 throwback
30:57
startup home pages um when did you write that article I wrote this in 2015. so this was one
31:04
month what month June oh you beat me on October 12 2015 I wrote an article that
31:10
said proof that your favorite startup started out awful and it's a list of 10 landing pages yeah
31:18
to each other then so uh you can go look at airbnbs it's like literally plain black and white and it's just says
31:24
forget hotels stay with a local Uber it looks like a you know janky thing everyone's private driver but it looks
31:31
like a old school car service Snapchat it's got one of these like yellow bubbles that's like the like buy now you
31:39
know like you know half buy two get one and it just says free download inside and it says introducing Snapchat
31:45
real-time picture chatting for iPhone and it's two girls and they're like bikinis and it just says seven seconds
31:50
on the screen and like you know a self-destructing photo so you can see what early startup landing pages look
31:55
like what's interesting that was unique in the hymns case is that they actually had their branding from day one which I
32:01
think was a smart move by them and they specifically branded it the opposite colors as every other male Wellness
32:07
product so every other Wellness product is essentially blue and they were like no we'll go all neutral color scheme
32:13
lowercase like lowercase font for the for the brand name and we're gonna make it subtle because there's a stigma and a
32:20
taboo around this it's not something you want to brag about we don't want bold we want like we want to be able to give you
32:25
this package in a discrete way and you know and I know and that's all who needs to know and I thought that was like a
32:30
smart thing for them to get right from day one all their models are like it's usually like a cool looking black dude or like a
32:36
racially ambiguous guy it's like some it's like oh I I can see myself in you
32:41
I'm a young cool guy with like I wear like cool jeans as well were your parents all of the Power Rangers why are
32:47
you also like that's what happened here it's usually like a like a pretty racially ambiguous good-looking guy with
32:53
nice teeth yeah yeah the tea throw is on point versus like a Viagra is always
32:59
like Brett Favre looking guy and then this was one of their early um early ads so it's just uh it just
33:06
says get hard or get your money back and it's just a guy holding a tiny pill um and it's and then what ethnicity is
33:13
that guy oh dude his hand is like a gradient in Photoshop it's like all all colors are
33:18
easy here uh so it says eggplant Emoji rise to the occasion for Less so one thing that they did really well was they
33:25
figured out how do you advertise on Facebook with a taboo product so they would do stuff like they would show a
33:30
picture of a cactus that was limp and then another and it would be like with hymns you don't have this problem so
33:36
like how do you and so they were very clever with their marketing they also did stuff where they would create ad
33:41
inventory so they would go to um like stadiums and they'd be like all right a bunch of guys who are in our
33:48
demographic are at the stadium we could either spend like four hundred thousand dollars to get on the Jumbotron and uh
33:55
along with like you know BMW and a bunch of other big brands or they went to the
34:01
stadium facility manager and they were like hey how much for the urinal space you're like what it's like yeah we want
34:06
to put a little ad on the urinal and we'll give you guys like you know X price to be in every urinal and they're
34:12
like yeah dude we got like 30 seconds of guys focused time while they're touching their thing like you know looking at our
34:18
ad this is actually kind of perfect and so they would create new ad inventory that didn't even exist before just
34:23
trying to figure out how do we spend 100 million dollars in a way that's going to be as efficient as possible so they're you know really just like very they're
34:30
like a very Advanced marketing agency essentially [Music]
34:36
worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but
34:41
HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot
34:48
grow better and another thing that they did I did a big breakdown on this one time was so if
34:54
you Google Viagra alternative or cheap Viagra or buy Viagra online they show up
35:00
number one and what they did was they actually sponsored a ton of twitch people and somehow that like got their
35:08
links out there and they like they got tons and tons of backlinks really early on so hymns.com ranked quite high so
35:16
they were able to get like it was I think if you I think it's Viagra alternative might be like their word I
35:21
forget which it's one of those pages and that's where they got most of the revenue early on oh wow that's interesting you know there's another
35:27
cool thing I'll put this graphic on the stream um it's this graphic from have you ever read Sakura by the way I don't know if
35:33
that's how you say it yeah yeah like the research thing I like it yeah they're pretty cool uh I don't think people know about them but it's uh like really good
35:40
research s-a-c-r-a yeah so they had done a thing and they had this great graphic which is
35:46
basically they were like telemedicine was like this like Trend like this like there's a lot of opportunity in
35:51
telemedicine right now and they just showed this picture of like a guy and a girl and it's a diagram and basically it's like you could look from like head
35:58
to toe literally from head to toe and you just go down the body you're like okay hair
36:03
there's hymns there's keeps there's Roman okay then you go down to like eyes
36:09
and it's like there's a prescription contact Hubble um you know it was it was a DVC startup doing prescription
36:15
contacts through a phone app instead of going to the doctor then you go to their bicep it's like trt
36:21
uh there's a bunch of trt companies like hone health and others and then you're like and then you go to uh you know
36:27
their abs like weight loss you go to the crotch it's like here's the erectile dysfunction you go down to the toes like
36:34
here's toe fungus he's got a little putt next to him it's like hey here's pop it's it's insurance for your pet so you
36:40
have like instead of going to the vet for everything you can use pop and um and so it's like
36:45
uh and then they do the same thing for women and you could just literally see like if you've seen those diagrams that
36:50
were like there was a big opportunity to unbundle Craigslist and they took Craigslist homepage and they showed out
36:56
every little section of Craigslist became its own billion dollar startup they did the same thing to your body every part of your body became a billion
37:02
dollar startup essentially from one d2c wellness company and uh or or multiple
37:08
in some in some areas so from Skin Care all of their logos look exactly the same
37:14
lowercase font pastel colors hymns I think it's oh by the way one one
37:21
other little observation a lot of these DDC successes came from a
37:27
certain type of founder not all of them but many from NBA found like Founders who went to like Business Schools which
37:33
is funny because like in the startup World Business Schools kind of like our easy punching bag because you're like punching up at the
37:39
institution it's easy to make fun of them like bro you don't learn business from school you learn business by doing business and that's how I feel to be
37:45
honest with you so I'm like that's true but there is something interesting that a lot of DDC companies Blue Apron
37:50
Birchbox Stitch fix Warby Parker um Rent the Runway
37:56
hellofresh um and then this you know this guy who did uh uh hymns he went to Wharton as
38:02
well so it's like a lot of these big I think there was something about the type of person who would do well in a
38:09
business school and the types of things you learn in business school where you like do this Market landscape you like figure out the opportunities you're like okay good I just need to be like good in
38:15
marketing and then good at operations in order to like like put cash in here and get thing out it's not like very
38:21
software based it's not in it you don't have to be the the innovator who's like you know the one inventor of something
38:28
um I think it lended itself to that type of entrepreneur which I found pretty interesting too
38:33
well here's what our listeners need to do they need to either probably in the YouTube comments they need to let us
38:40
know I actually want to do who on The Duel I actually want them to I want to know if they think Kansas is a good
38:45
business but also who won the duel so you'll have to vote by saying our names
38:52
um we'll include a Spotify poll as well so you can just vote in the app
38:57
and we'll do a Spotify poll as well if some guy in the YouTube channel said um
39:02
um who's this blonde host and why is he so annoying so just for the record the blonde annoying guy
39:09
that's what someone said in the comment the the blonde annoying guy that was Sam I went first and Sean is the brown less
39:15
annoying guy he went second for him so let us know who's the winner here of the of this duel
39:21
um I'm very eager to hear uh what people gonna say I know which one I would rather own but I think they're both
39:27
quite interesting for sure for sure you saw this post by Mark Zuckerberg
39:33
that he did the Murph I tweeted out the picture of it and it got like five million views it kind of
39:40
took off and I don't know so do you know what the Murph is I had never heard of the Murph until I
39:47
saw this and then I was like I must do the Murph it's named after lieutenant Murphy I believe context clues leads me
39:55
to believe that he died uh in the military and uh his favorite workout I
40:00
believe it's one mile run 300 squats a hundred push-ups and 100
40:07
pull-ups and then I'm one mile run all while wearing a 20 pound weighted vest
40:12
is that the workout that's exactly right run a mile 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 squats run
40:18
another mile while wait while wearing a 20 pound vest and uh Zuck basically takes a like bro
40:27
gym shot I gotta use the Blackberry for this he's got the phone down here
40:32
not smiling got the mouth open just and just snaps it with himself drenched
40:38
in sweat and he's like just did the Murph um he's like me and my daughters dude he's
40:44
got a picture of his daughters doing like push-ups and he goes I this year I got it done in 39 minutes and 58 seconds
40:51
and I was like I read that and I was like hmm that sounds like really fast if he had just said I did 100 pull-ups
40:57
today I would have been like man what a day fantastic forget all the rest I was
41:03
already impressed by 100 Pull-Ups to say he got that done weighted Pull-Ups
41:08
so say you got that done in 39 minutes I was like that sounds ridiculously fast and sure enough all the comments were
41:14
like that's an insane time for the Murph have you ever done this workout I haven't but the world record holder of
41:20
the Murph is this guy named Hunter McIntyre who's dm'd me on Twitter and Instagram and I've talked to because I
41:26
like him a lot or I followed him and I feel like I like him is that what fit guys do they just DM each other yeah
41:32
yeah yeah yeah it's like a club you know like once you can see the sixth app you start smelling each other yeah I'm one
41:38
of us good to see you and he DN me he listens to the pot he's the world record holder
41:43
and I think his world record is like 34 minutes and zuck's time was 39 minutes
41:49
which means he would have gotten like 10th or 15th Place at there's like a
41:54
Murph gains or something like that I mean I had so many thoughts brushed through my head when I saw this first I
41:59
saw 39 minutes and I thought I've taken shits longer than that like that's a that's a crazy fast time then I
42:06
thought I don't think I could even do a Murph in an infinite amount of time I don't think in my life I have done a
42:12
total of two miles running 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups and 300 air squats like with a
42:19
20 pound vest I have just never done it period uh so my time is currently 35 years then I thought
42:26
this mother this guy has he decided yo you know what I'll just
42:31
become one of the richest people in the world one of the most powerful people in the world and the one of the fittest
42:37
guys in the world like he's basically wholesome top point one percent wealth
42:43
top point one percent you know intelligence top point one percent power and now he's top Point top one point one
42:49
percent Chad also I am all before the age of 40.
42:54
yeah exactly and he's got two kids or something like that I'm like I mean David Goggins should go to sleep
43:03
listening to Mark Zuckerberg videos for motivation this guy is incredible I went
43:08
I bought more stock and I bought a plain gray you know cookie cutter t-shirt in his honor I was like this is I'm gonna
43:15
retire this is the rafters of my office I'm gonna put it I'm gonna hang a gray shirt just to honor this man he can get
43:21
so much [ __ ] and man he's really turned his like public Persona around like do
43:26
you remember he was he was the biggest dork like not just like oh when he was young like
43:33
recently he was the biggest dork is that he tried to do something cool like he would do when he did that like Hydro
43:39
foiling thing and he painted his fight his face white like a geisha and like it's like man this guy's like
43:46
and hit American fight it was just like it was like oh man like you know what keep all your money I don't want to be
43:52
here and now he's like you know just got off work did a quick
43:57
Jiu Jitsu tournament came back you know [ __ ] deleted Snapchat off the Earth I'm like wow this guy's just this guy's
44:03
making power moves all day he's incredible he's he's a very inspirational dude he's done it Scandal
44:09
free so Zuck is only 37 now you know probably fifth or sixth is he's only 37.
44:15
something like that I mean he's still in his 30s how old is he
44:21
39 39. so he so basically he uh been
44:26
married to the same woman been with her since college has two kids seems like his family life on on paper seems
44:33
awesome there was a time when like the most scandalous thing that he did was he had a video where he talked about
44:39
smoking meats and every year he sets you remember that because every year he has
44:44
goals no no that's not the scandalous thing that was just like hilarious that he was a robot trying to be like hello
44:50
humans I am doing a barbecue with I have flesh on a grill with fire and I was
44:55
like bro this is the robot the most scandalous thing he did was when he was in college and the the his aim messages
45:01
got leaked that was like you know a real wonderful day in my household as I like was like Hey cancel Netflix I have my
45:08
entertainment for the week I'm reading all of Mark Zuckerberg's aim messages for the next week that and it wasn't
45:13
even that big of a deal what he said was pretty on par with an 18 year old 19 year old person like well
45:20
maybe it was one part was a little bit like uh is this what we want like this guy's this is the guy running Facebook
45:26
where he was like he's like yeah he's like he's like yeah just tell me if you want anyone's like you know name do you
45:33
know date of birth you know address whatever he's like these dumb [ __ ] just just trust me they just put everything
45:38
in the system and so yeah like something a 19 year old kid who invented this stuff would say
45:44
yeah I would say that was the last time I was relatable with Mark Zuckerberg
45:50
ever since then he's created a gap and he's outpaced me from there every year
45:55
he sets these goals one year it was he only wants to eat food that he killed or grew and I think he did it and then
46:01
another year he was like I'm gonna learn Mandarin because I want Facebook to come to China and I think his wife is Chinese
46:08
and he was like I'm Gonna Learn man and then he goes and he gives a talk I think he does it gives a talk to a
46:14
Chinese Universe he gave me an interview they go he they fly him out there they're like thank you so much Mark Zuckerberg for coming we are so happy to
46:20
have you and he's like he's like yo well Mitchell and he just starts speaking Chinese and they're like blown away it's
46:28
like really great Amanda where he's basically fluent and so the guy kills it
46:33
man he does great and like when he did the E4 so he got into e-foiling which is basically surfboarding without a wave
46:40
and he is doing it with an American flag and he has too much sunscreen on his face that's my guy a guy whose biggest
46:47
like flaw is that he's goofy it's not the I know my guy and then now that I
46:52
said you're zagging the other way you're saying Zuck bad move unrelatable too too
46:59
good no vulnerability no no relatability now he's no longer Girl Next Door hot
47:04
now he's just super model hot it sucks the best man he just he you know our friend Nikita beer uh has this joke
47:11
where he said something like I would never I forget why he says this but he says never ever ever bet against Zuck
47:17
how he's just a complete killer and he is wrong sometimes but not in the grand scheme and this is for the proof well
47:23
the funny thing is people will hate this segment because I think it's popular to really hate Mark Zuckerberg
47:30
um because they hate Facebook I think because they're like my data or like the
47:35
Russians hacked the election I'm not even sure I'm not even sure what the what the exact reason is for hating
47:40
Zuckerberg at this point I just gotta say like this is
47:45
I mean he he is inspiring in that he is excellent and if you appreciate Excellence that is kind of inspiring
47:52
it's kind of like people who hate LeBron it's like okay I get it you don't have to like the guy but uh I mean you gotta
47:58
respect that puts a perspective on this guy's name is wrong either by the way like people played sometimes
48:05
yeah exactly yeah it might yeah he switched teams when he was a free agent um my real estate agent told me the
48:12
story that she was driving my she's like that's Mark Zuckerberg's house in the in the mission kind of like near Dolores Park type of
48:18
area and I was like he lives here and I was like that's not like I thought he'd live in some private gated community and
48:24
she was like well let me think he has like many houses but this is one this is one and this is like his main one for a while
48:29
and she's like and he made it private I said what do you mean I don't see any fence and she's like no he bought the
48:34
houses next door like he just bought all the houses in the area so that like you know whatever and so he he knocked on
48:41
someone's door himself so somebody opened the door and it was Mark Zuckerberg outside and he's like
48:48
hey you know I love this house and I would you sell it to me and they're like
48:54
no I mean it's not for sale we love this house we're so close to the park you know my commute it's only seven miles he's like I'll give you 10 million
49:00
dollars and you're like okay here's the keys basically he bought the house for 10 million it was probably a two million
49:05
dollar house uh and the house next like the house is nearby two and a half three billion dollars and he paid ten and just
49:12
got the house right away dude that person who sold their house to him would be the best dinner guest imagine that
49:17
story we'd like to have you on air if that's you we would like to have you come tell that story because uh
49:24
obviously I'm reenacting what I was told by a real estate agent I don't know if that's that's true or that's [ __ ]
49:29
um so yeah Zuck amazing Let's uh wrap up with this last thing this Nike thing
49:35
did you watch this movie uh air yeah I did I thought it was awesome it was
49:40
pretty sweet right like uh not the best movie but like a just a solid base hit on a Thursday night a Friday night you
49:48
know you just need something that's I don't want to sit here and browse Netflix for the perfect thing all right I'm just gonna go on I think
49:54
it's on Amazon and I'm just gonna go watch air and like this just watch the story of how Nike signed Michael Jordan they made
50:02
Phil Knight look like a doofus yeah why did they do that I didn't understand that they uh well he does
50:08
like appearance-wise look like a doofus but they also made him act like a doofus yeah which I don't think he was like
50:13
that when I read true dog I didn't get that idea he he he he he's more I think uh they made him look like when he wrote
50:20
his own Memoir he made himself sound cool well I've read a lot I've read a lot about him he he they just kind of
50:26
made him look like a like a like a ditzy person like an idiot yeah he's not an idiot
50:31
um but the guy they feature so a couple things so so first uh anything stand out from the movie air but then I have I
50:37
want to go deep on this guy Sonny Vaccaro because I think he's actually more interesting who was that the main character I don't
50:42
remember his name that's that's the main character so that's Matt Damon uh Matt Damon in the movie but um you know in in
50:48
Nike in the air movie I thought one one is something I didn't know was they're they're talking about just do it which
50:54
is the just do it's the slogan that you know everybody knows it's the Nike kind of like iconic slogan and they were
51:01
talking about like at the time even people internally were like just do it like they got that from the Ad Agency Wyden Kennedy and they're like I don't
51:07
know what what does that what does that mean do you like it it's like I don't know it's okay I guess they weren't like yes this is this is gonna be this like
51:14
marketing Masterpiece and they go what does that even mean and they go dude it's from an inmate on death row who was
51:21
about to be assassin about to be executed and they were like any last words and he goes just do it
51:26
so that became the Nike slogan which is uh honestly kind of Genius
51:32
um so I want to talk about this guy Sonny Vaccaro because he's kind of a gangster that I've seen for many many years in
51:38
the basketball scene and the movie was about him and he this guy's pretty fascinating so
51:44
what uh in the movie he's famous because he's working at Nike at the time Nike is
51:50
the last player it's just a running shoe company and they're the smaller shoe company uh Adidas is This Global brand
51:56
that's crushing it they own most of the sneaker Market uh I believe it's pronounced Adidas yeah Adidas
52:04
which has its own interesting story then Reebok is like number two and Nike's
52:09
like a distant three but they were doing like 27 million a year in sales through their running shoot so good but not like
52:15
nowhere near the kind of top tier uh of shoe companies and so Sunny meets Phil
52:21
Knight and he's like hey I got an idea for a basketball shoe I want to create like a basketball Division like you guys are all running shoes which is great
52:27
basketball shoes and he's like okay like come on in and you get this little basketball Department like go ahead try
52:33
to make it work and the movie is all about like one breakthrough thing he did which was
52:40
they had a tiny budget and in the 1984 draft they decided to sponsor Michael
52:46
Jordan and Michael Jordan was not interested in Nike he was going to go with uh I think Adidas or somebody like
52:51
that and um he was known as a hot Prospect he's like the number three pick and they were like
52:57
well we still want and and Sonny was convinced we need Michael Jordan and so the movie's about them trying to go get
53:02
Michael Jordan on Borden and what ended up what they what the pitch was was basically they put her entire Budget on
53:07
one guy instead of spreading across multiple players he relentlessly pursued Jordan and like
53:13
met his mom and like just like drove out there to North Carolina to meet them and try to build a relationship and then
53:19
they didn't even showed Jordan's face in the movie which actually was pretty cool it was basically the whole relationship was how do I impress his mom because I
53:25
know his mom will have my back she's making the decisions and so they were like well um we're gonna pitch him on his own
53:31
signature shoe from day one and we're gonna name it after him um so it'll be the Air Jordan it'll be a
53:37
whole product line named after him and he ended up negotiating a royalty on every pair of Jordans sold and that's
53:43
how Michael Jordan became a billionaire not through basketball but through his shoes so that's the movie part okay cool this guy Sonny actually did a bunch of
53:49
other interesting things that I thought were pretty cool so as a marketer I just respect this guy's hustle so here's some
53:55
of the things he did to make Nike win um he created so he was like all right we gotta create like um like a kid's
54:03
strategy it's like how do we get him while they're young and so he created a high school All-American Game so he was
54:10
like he called it the uh the Dapper band round ball classic he goes throughout the country he's like I'm inviting you
54:15
to participate you're going to compete against you know the the 12 best players um we're gonna have 20 best players in
