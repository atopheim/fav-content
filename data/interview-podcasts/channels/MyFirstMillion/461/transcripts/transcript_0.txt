I'm gonna blow your mind ready so Scotland you know Scotland you've heard of that country Scotland right
you've heard of that place familiar land of kilts and sheeps but also redheads
but okay and redheads but it's also home to one of the coolest SAS businesses that I've ever heard of so it's called
petroleum exports uh they it's known as uh pet tax [Music]
let's jump in we got a bunch of stuff today we're gonna do what's called a business breakdown duel
Sean and I you know is that a western duel I guess is uh we
both did a business breakdown and we didn't know that the other one was gonna do it and so now we're gonna compare I'm
gonna go first which gives you the advantage because the person who goes last always usually wins in rap battles
because that's it's always like when you you know like when I do you know when they do the Applause or like person a
person B if person B always wins I get to hear you say your thing and
then I can make fun of what you said yeah so anyway you're gonna you get the advantage but that's okay so I'll go
first okay but before I go first I've got to give a shout out to Andrew Lynch from net income um it's a sub stack it's where I
I found uh this particular business and I'm just and I'm stealing uh a lot of his numbers but
I'm gonna blow your mind ready so Scotland you know Scotland you've heard of that country Scotland right
you've heard of that place familiar land of kilts and sheeps but also I think
they're sheeps there I don't actually know that's how little I know about Scotland but also redheads but okay and
redheads but it's also home to one of the coolest SAS businesses that I've ever heard of so it's called petroleum
exports uh they it's known as uh pet tax pad tax it's a challenging name I know
and it's a highly technical specialist software crucial for oil and gas operations you can go to
p-e-t-e-x.com to check it out so pull that up but pet pet tax it's a highly
technical specialist software that's the backbone of some of the most important operations in the oil and gas industry
and it sounds boring and that's because it is however they last year they made 78 million
pounds in Revenue which is about 100 million dollars USD and on that 100
million dollars in Revenue about 67 million of it was profit and of that of
that profit they basically took out all the money so they paid a dividend of 41 million pounds which is about 60 million
dollars and that was paid to the owner and it wasn't even retained to the company which means for every dollar they took about 52 dollars went directly
to the or 52 cents went directly to the owner's pocket now
here's the cool part none of this is rumors this isn't hearsay I'm not like telling you I heard a story because in
the UK If you're a privately held company that hits a certain threshold in Revenue you have to submit your reports
and you could just log in it's called company's house you can just go there and you can log in you can see all this information and so I went and looked at
many many many years of their data and I'm going to tell you a story about how this company came to be so it was
started by this guy name we're gonna call him Aid his name's Abe his name he's he's a Muslim guy very very very
challenging uh first and last name can you see his name can you tell me how to pronounce that do you know how to pronounce that
is the first name and the last name it's very challenging there's a d and there's a j together that's a very challenging
okay so you are calling him ape or he goes by Abe I'm calling him Abe his last name is if you look at it if it meant
many Muslim AES but uh we're gonna call him his last name has a d and a j next to each other I don't even know how to
pronounce that sound so I'm sorry it's a very challenging name to
pronounce so he started the company in 1990 it was based in Al Aberdeen
Scotland which is basically like a hub for oil industry it's kind of like similar to what Houston in America is
and the company originally served as a petroleum consultant for in uh Consultants to the control petroleum
industry as well as retailers and they would create these mathematical models to help uh people in the in the oil and
gas industry manage their projects and so today they've kind of pivoted from
Consulting to providing software they only have 420 customers and their core product is composed of complex products
which are complex features that with descriptions like a multi-phase network modeling and optimization and thorough
Dynamics fluid characterization package so pretty complicated stuff so as I said they started as a Consulting business
and they did have done 78 million pounds in Revenue last year which is about 100 million USD 58 million USD in profit and
50 million in dividends meaning the company doesn't require much capital x so they made all this profit in most all
of it 58 million profit 50 million came out of the business and went directly to the owner's pockets and he's been doing
this for years and years and years their business biggest expense is employees so
because they're based in the UK they pay UK software engineer salaries which are lower than the US making their average
all-in cost per each employee of which they have 86 of them only a hundred and one thousand pounds per year so the
which means that they are doing 911 pounds 900 911 000 pounds in Revenue per
employee so 9x 9x basically Roi per person that they hired so yeah this
company absolutely kills it and I want to tell you when I was analyzing this company and um if you look up Andrew
Lynch his sub stack he does a really good job of explaining the technical details of the company I want to explain
some of the entrepreneurial takeaways that I had so if you go to the top uh link Sean in our doc
um or at the beginning of the story you'll see the sub stack where you can it's his Andrew Lynch has a thing called
net income and that's where I discovered this so I want to tell you some of my takeaways takeaway one Focus plus time
that's what this guy did so everyone talks about Focus but what does Focus means you basically in my opinion need
to focus enough to turn your idea into a machine and then after that I think you can deviate some attention away from
that if you want but the company needs focus and that Focus took takes time so I went back and I looked at a lot of
their uh revenue and so did Andrew so if you scroll down Sean you'll see a graph
of the revenue and what you'll notice is that it took them 15 years to get to 10
million dollars in Revenue 10 million pounds I'm going to call it dollars so 10 million dollars in revenue and I know
a lot of people I think maybe you have done this with one of your businesses got to close to 10 million Revenue in like 1.5 or one or two years actually
and so 15 years particularly in like the tech Internet space
it feels horribly long but I think that's okay that's the right feeling and so what I try to do something I've been
thinking about for a while is I ask myself in 10 or 20 years will I be happy if I started this today and that's a
really good quote but that answer is incredibly murky more
often than not sometimes it's like a I think yes it's a very murky thing and there's this famous story about Jeff
Bezos when he started Amazon he has this thing called the regret minimalization framework where he says this story about
he's like well even though he had this good job I decided to start Amazon because in 80 years when I meet or when I'm 80 years old will I be proud that I
started it today the answer was yes but in that same story he also said that he
thought at most Amazon could make is a hundred million dollars a year so he he's not like he had the full picture so
it was like yeah I think this can work and so I went and talked to darmesh who's the founder of dharmesha the founder of HubSpot I also talked to Kip
