hellofresh um and then this you know this guy who did uh uh hymns he went to Wharton as
well so it's like a lot of these big I think there was something about the type of person who would do well in a
business school and the types of things you learn in business school where you like do this Market landscape you like figure out the opportunities you're like okay good I just need to be like good in
marketing and then good at operations in order to like like put cash in here and get thing out it's not like very
software based it's not in it you don't have to be the the innovator who's like you know the one inventor of something
um I think it lended itself to that type of entrepreneur which I found pretty interesting too
well here's what our listeners need to do they need to either probably in the YouTube comments they need to let us
know I actually want to do who on The Duel I actually want them to I want to know if they think Kansas is a good
business but also who won the duel so you'll have to vote by saying our names
um we'll include a Spotify poll as well so you can just vote in the app
and we'll do a Spotify poll as well if some guy in the YouTube channel said um
um who's this blonde host and why is he so annoying so just for the record the blonde annoying guy
that's what someone said in the comment the the blonde annoying guy that was Sam I went first and Sean is the brown less
annoying guy he went second for him so let us know who's the winner here of the of this duel
um I'm very eager to hear uh what people gonna say I know which one I would rather own but I think they're both
quite interesting for sure for sure you saw this post by Mark Zuckerberg
that he did the Murph I tweeted out the picture of it and it got like five million views it kind of
took off and I don't know so do you know what the Murph is I had never heard of the Murph until I
saw this and then I was like I must do the Murph it's named after lieutenant Murphy I believe context clues leads me
to believe that he died uh in the military and uh his favorite workout I
believe it's one mile run 300 squats a hundred push-ups and 100
pull-ups and then I'm one mile run all while wearing a 20 pound weighted vest
is that the workout that's exactly right run a mile 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 squats run
another mile while wait while wearing a 20 pound vest and uh Zuck basically takes a like bro
gym shot I gotta use the Blackberry for this he's got the phone down here
not smiling got the mouth open just and just snaps it with himself drenched
in sweat and he's like just did the Murph um he's like me and my daughters dude he's
got a picture of his daughters doing like push-ups and he goes I this year I got it done in 39 minutes and 58 seconds
and I was like I read that and I was like hmm that sounds like really fast if he had just said I did 100 pull-ups
today I would have been like man what a day fantastic forget all the rest I was
already impressed by 100 Pull-Ups to say he got that done weighted Pull-Ups
so say you got that done in 39 minutes I was like that sounds ridiculously fast and sure enough all the comments were
like that's an insane time for the Murph have you ever done this workout I haven't but the world record holder of
the Murph is this guy named Hunter McIntyre who's dm'd me on Twitter and Instagram and I've talked to because I
like him a lot or I followed him and I feel like I like him is that what fit guys do they just DM each other yeah
yeah yeah yeah it's like a club you know like once you can see the sixth app you start smelling each other yeah I'm one
of us good to see you and he DN me he listens to the pot he's the world record holder
and I think his world record is like 34 minutes and zuck's time was 39 minutes
which means he would have gotten like 10th or 15th Place at there's like a
Murph gains or something like that I mean I had so many thoughts brushed through my head when I saw this first I
saw 39 minutes and I thought I've taken shits longer than that like that's a that's a crazy fast time then I
thought I don't think I could even do a Murph in an infinite amount of time I don't think in my life I have done a
total of two miles running 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups and 300 air squats like with a
20 pound vest I have just never done it period uh so my time is currently 35 years then I thought
this mother this guy has he decided yo you know what I'll just
become one of the richest people in the world one of the most powerful people in the world and the one of the fittest
guys in the world like he's basically wholesome top point one percent wealth
top point one percent you know intelligence top point one percent power and now he's top Point top one point one
percent Chad also I am all before the age of 40.
yeah exactly and he's got two kids or something like that I'm like I mean David Goggins should go to sleep
listening to Mark Zuckerberg videos for motivation this guy is incredible I went
I bought more stock and I bought a plain gray you know cookie cutter t-shirt in his honor I was like this is I'm gonna
retire this is the rafters of my office I'm gonna put it I'm gonna hang a gray shirt just to honor this man he can get
so much [ __ ] and man he's really turned his like public Persona around like do
you remember he was he was the biggest dork like not just like oh when he was young like
recently he was the biggest dork is that he tried to do something cool like he would do when he did that like Hydro
foiling thing and he painted his fight his face white like a geisha and like it's like man this guy's like
and hit American fight it was just like it was like oh man like you know what keep all your money I don't want to be
here and now he's like you know just got off work did a quick
Jiu Jitsu tournament came back you know [ __ ] deleted Snapchat off the Earth I'm like wow this guy's just this guy's
making power moves all day he's incredible he's he's a very inspirational dude he's done it Scandal
free so Zuck is only 37 now you know probably fifth or sixth is he's only 37.
something like that I mean he's still in his 30s how old is he
39 39. so he so basically he uh been
married to the same woman been with her since college has two kids seems like his family life on on paper seems
awesome there was a time when like the most scandalous thing that he did was he had a video where he talked about
smoking meats and every year he sets you remember that because every year he has
goals no no that's not the scandalous thing that was just like hilarious that he was a robot trying to be like hello
humans I am doing a barbecue with I have flesh on a grill with fire and I was
like bro this is the robot the most scandalous thing he did was when he was in college and the the his aim messages
got leaked that was like you know a real wonderful day in my household as I like was like Hey cancel Netflix I have my
entertainment for the week I'm reading all of Mark Zuckerberg's aim messages for the next week that and it wasn't
even that big of a deal what he said was pretty on par with an 18 year old 19 year old person like well
maybe it was one part was a little bit like uh is this what we want like this guy's this is the guy running Facebook
where he was like he's like yeah he's like he's like yeah just tell me if you want anyone's like you know name do you
know date of birth you know address whatever he's like these dumb [ __ ] just just trust me they just put everything
in the system and so yeah like something a 19 year old kid who invented this stuff would say
yeah I would say that was the last time I was relatable with Mark Zuckerberg
ever since then he's created a gap and he's outpaced me from there every year
he sets these goals one year it was he only wants to eat food that he killed or grew and I think he did it and then
another year he was like I'm gonna learn Mandarin because I want Facebook to come to China and I think his wife is Chinese
