love love love looking at successful businesses early landing pages just to see like how did they get their business
out the door one thing that's interesting is from the beginning they actually had a pretty strong like branding and brand identity so if you go
do this with like Snapchat or Uber the first websites are just absolutely fugly like um I have this blog post on the
internet that's called like you just search Sean Prairie uh early startup
landing pages medium um 10th okay it's called 10 throwback
startup home pages um when did you write that article I wrote this in 2015. so this was one
month what month June oh you beat me on October 12 2015 I wrote an article that
said proof that your favorite startup started out awful and it's a list of 10 landing pages yeah
to each other then so uh you can go look at airbnbs it's like literally plain black and white and it's just says
forget hotels stay with a local Uber it looks like a you know janky thing everyone's private driver but it looks
like a old school car service Snapchat it's got one of these like yellow bubbles that's like the like buy now you
know like you know half buy two get one and it just says free download inside and it says introducing Snapchat
real-time picture chatting for iPhone and it's two girls and they're like bikinis and it just says seven seconds
on the screen and like you know a self-destructing photo so you can see what early startup landing pages look
like what's interesting that was unique in the hymns case is that they actually had their branding from day one which I
think was a smart move by them and they specifically branded it the opposite colors as every other male Wellness
product so every other Wellness product is essentially blue and they were like no we'll go all neutral color scheme
lowercase like lowercase font for the for the brand name and we're gonna make it subtle because there's a stigma and a
taboo around this it's not something you want to brag about we don't want bold we want like we want to be able to give you
this package in a discrete way and you know and I know and that's all who needs to know and I thought that was like a
smart thing for them to get right from day one all their models are like it's usually like a cool looking black dude or like a
racially ambiguous guy it's like some it's like oh I I can see myself in you
I'm a young cool guy with like I wear like cool jeans as well were your parents all of the Power Rangers why are
you also like that's what happened here it's usually like a like a pretty racially ambiguous good-looking guy with
nice teeth yeah yeah the tea throw is on point versus like a Viagra is always
like Brett Favre looking guy and then this was one of their early um early ads so it's just uh it just
says get hard or get your money back and it's just a guy holding a tiny pill um and it's and then what ethnicity is
that guy oh dude his hand is like a gradient in Photoshop it's like all all colors are
easy here uh so it says eggplant Emoji rise to the occasion for Less so one thing that they did really well was they
figured out how do you advertise on Facebook with a taboo product so they would do stuff like they would show a
picture of a cactus that was limp and then another and it would be like with hymns you don't have this problem so
like how do you and so they were very clever with their marketing they also did stuff where they would create ad
inventory so they would go to um like stadiums and they'd be like all right a bunch of guys who are in our
demographic are at the stadium we could either spend like four hundred thousand dollars to get on the Jumbotron and uh
along with like you know BMW and a bunch of other big brands or they went to the
stadium facility manager and they were like hey how much for the urinal space you're like what it's like yeah we want
to put a little ad on the urinal and we'll give you guys like you know X price to be in every urinal and they're
like yeah dude we got like 30 seconds of guys focused time while they're touching their thing like you know looking at our
ad this is actually kind of perfect and so they would create new ad inventory that didn't even exist before just
trying to figure out how do we spend 100 million dollars in a way that's going to be as efficient as possible so they're you know really just like very they're
like a very Advanced marketing agency essentially [Music]
worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but
HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot
grow better and another thing that they did I did a big breakdown on this one time was so if
you Google Viagra alternative or cheap Viagra or buy Viagra online they show up
number one and what they did was they actually sponsored a ton of twitch people and somehow that like got their
links out there and they like they got tons and tons of backlinks really early on so hymns.com ranked quite high so
they were able to get like it was I think if you I think it's Viagra alternative might be like their word I
forget which it's one of those pages and that's where they got most of the revenue early on oh wow that's interesting you know there's another
cool thing I'll put this graphic on the stream um it's this graphic from have you ever read Sakura by the way I don't know if
that's how you say it yeah yeah like the research thing I like it yeah they're pretty cool uh I don't think people know about them but it's uh like really good
research s-a-c-r-a yeah so they had done a thing and they had this great graphic which is
basically they were like telemedicine was like this like Trend like this like there's a lot of opportunity in
telemedicine right now and they just showed this picture of like a guy and a girl and it's a diagram and basically it's like you could look from like head
to toe literally from head to toe and you just go down the body you're like okay hair
there's hymns there's keeps there's Roman okay then you go down to like eyes
and it's like there's a prescription contact Hubble um you know it was it was a DVC startup doing prescription
contacts through a phone app instead of going to the doctor then you go to their bicep it's like trt
uh there's a bunch of trt companies like hone health and others and then you're like and then you go to uh you know
their abs like weight loss you go to the crotch it's like here's the erectile dysfunction you go down to the toes like
here's toe fungus he's got a little putt next to him it's like hey here's pop it's it's insurance for your pet so you
have like instead of going to the vet for everything you can use pop and um and so it's like
uh and then they do the same thing for women and you could just literally see like if you've seen those diagrams that
were like there was a big opportunity to unbundle Craigslist and they took Craigslist homepage and they showed out
every little section of Craigslist became its own billion dollar startup they did the same thing to your body every part of your body became a billion
dollar startup essentially from one d2c wellness company and uh or or multiple
in some in some areas so from Skin Care all of their logos look exactly the same
lowercase font pastel colors hymns I think it's oh by the way one one
other little observation a lot of these DDC successes came from a
certain type of founder not all of them but many from NBA found like Founders who went to like Business Schools which
is funny because like in the startup World Business Schools kind of like our easy punching bag because you're like punching up at the
institution it's easy to make fun of them like bro you don't learn business from school you learn business by doing business and that's how I feel to be
honest with you so I'm like that's true but there is something interesting that a lot of DDC companies Blue Apron
Birchbox Stitch fix Warby Parker um Rent the Runway
