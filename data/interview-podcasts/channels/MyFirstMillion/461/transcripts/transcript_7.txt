know his mom will have my back she's making the decisions and so they were like well um we're gonna pitch him on his own
signature shoe from day one and we're gonna name it after him um so it'll be the Air Jordan it'll be a
whole product line named after him and he ended up negotiating a royalty on every pair of Jordans sold and that's
how Michael Jordan became a billionaire not through basketball but through his shoes so that's the movie part okay cool this guy Sonny actually did a bunch of
other interesting things that I thought were pretty cool so as a marketer I just respect this guy's hustle so here's some
of the things he did to make Nike win um he created so he was like all right we gotta create like um like a kid's
strategy it's like how do we get him while they're young and so he created a high school All-American Game so he was
like he called it the uh the Dapper band round ball classic he goes throughout the country he's like I'm inviting you
to participate you're going to compete against you know the the 12 best players um we're gonna have 20 best players in
the country you're invited to come do this thing in in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia or some [ __ ] like that and
it was like uh and so he flies them out there and he puts this thing together now he's got the players so then he goes
and tells all the college coaches hey if you're scouting you need to come to this round ball class you can see all the best high school players at once and so
then college coaches start coming so now players are like oh if I want to get seen by college coaches I gotta get to
the high school All-American Game so he just like created through Brute Force like a conference essentially that would
uh bring together the kind of the core supply and demand and then he could find at that age the best young players and
so he that's how he found Kobe Bryant that's how he found LeBron James they were part of his high school All-American things in his Camp so the
second thing he did was he created a summer camp for only the best players called ABCD any brand this is when he
was with Adidas so this guy worked for Nike then he worked for Adidas then he worked for Reebok so he just this guy
was just a hired assassin that went from company to company and would just try to get them to win in their Market using
whatever advantages they had and so when Nike needed something he was like all right you need to get them while they're young we're gonna do this camp but also
what we're going to do is we need to get college players wearing our stuff they all wear Adidas and uh because it's the
most popular brand so that's just what they choose by default or they choose Converse and so he's like you know why don't we um you can't pay College
athletes but nobody say anything about coaches and so he just started he would go to
the coaches and he'd be like hey I'm gonna give you 10 grand and here's 26 pairs of shoes give them out oh they
happen to be the sizes of like most of your guys uh they don't have to wear them you get the 10 grand either way but we sure do hope you would uh you know
you would go ahead and uh and um you know encourage them to wear these shoes and so he went to Jim beehive and he
went to like you know all the top college coaches and he basically bribed them and it was like in this gray area where it was allowed and in one year he
just traveled like he would just fly City to City he would go to the campus he would make the coach and offer and at the time they were buying this equipment
for their program they're like our kids need equipment so we got to buy this the stuff so we turn to cost into revenue
for them and gave them free stuff and sure enough all of them started wearing Nikes for free so all of a sudden now
Nike's being worn by all the best college players and it's on TV and in one year he just did a land grab across
the country before the other companies could could react he got all of them and I thought this was just like a genius uh
genus strategy he started how far you can go with Brute Force
this was a sledgehammer this was a sledgehammer and you can get pretty far with the sledgehammer
then then he did another thing he sued the NCAA so he went to this guy Edo
Bannon and he was like hey we should sue the NCAA they're using your name your face you're like this to market the
tournament and all the stuff and you're getting nothing from it and now college players can get paid through this nil
rule this name and like this thing and it's because he won the case with that
uh lawsuit uh against the NCAA that was like you know it happened the lawsuit happened the last time about five years
or so then the rule came into effect like a year ago or something and so um
so I thought that was awesome uh there were some great quotes about him some guy goes uh
when Sonny dies he's gonna sneak his way into heaven and uh and when he gets
there the first thing he's gonna do is he's gonna look for a six nine kid to make a deal with like he's like and the
other thing they said is there's only one man on Earth who could tell you who the best sixth grade basketball player in the country is and it's sunny Vaccaro
and I just love that this guy just like owned his Niche and just absolutely like
went balls to the wall and really built like I don't know tens of billions of
value at least inside of Nike Plus Adidas plus Reebok with these athletes and he would have also gotten so he
signed Jordan he sang he he got he poached Kobe away from Adidas and that he would have got LeBron too when he was
at Adidas and LeBron was ready to sign he goes we need to offer him 10 million a year for 10 years 100 million dollar contract to this 18 year old kid
and rabon's ready to sign and then Adidas gave him the 10 million but they changed the structure last minute they
got a little cold feet and they're like well we don't know if this kid's gonna work out why don't we make it part of an incentive based and so they offered him
seven million guaranteed and 3 million a year of incentives and LeBron turned it down ends up going Nike never looked
back and like just a huge blunder like basically this guy's whole life he was fighting bureaucracy inside companies
and then doing like black market and gray hat [ __ ] in the like you know in
the streets and every NBA player is like no sonny their parents know Sunny because this guy was just working the streets and like there are certain
companies that have had this Tinder kind of had this with um what's her name the Whitney wolf who started bumble she was
kind of doing this from college campus to college campus like going into the sorority houses and the Frat houses and
just brute force onboarding all the guys and girls in one campus so that Tinder was useful and then throwing parties and
doing stuff like that and like you need these people these are like game-changing people for your company I
remember when coinbase went public uh Brian Armstrong did this long thread he did something you never see somebody
do which was company goes public they usually just say generic stuff he actually talked about like what led
coinbase to be successful and he called out one guy by name that wasn't his co-founder wasn't his main investor it
was just an employee and this guy Dan Romero and he's like and you know it's basically special thanks to Dan Romero
who like just kind of like Brute Force built our relationships with banks and
he he basically got them their relationships with banking partners and like I think maybe some stuff overseas
um and it was just kind of like one of those things like dude I don't know how we're gonna do this I don't know Dan that's your mission send them on a mission to go do that and Dan basically
joined coinbase coinbase as an employee ended up making like 100 million dollars plus through this process
um and I knew this guy I met him in college he was in my case yeah didn't he uh didn't you like used to make fun of
