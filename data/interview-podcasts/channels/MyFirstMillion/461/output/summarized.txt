The hosts discuss a Scottish company called Petroleum Experts (also known as Petex), which provides highly technical, specialist software that is crucial for operations in the oil and gas industry. The software is the backbone of some of the most important operations in the oil and gas industry.

The company was started by an individual named Abe (the hosts call him this due to the complexity of his real name) in 1990 in Aberdeen, Scotland, a hub for the oil industry. Initially, it served as a petroleum consultant for the petroleum industry as well as retailers, creating mathematical models to help manage projects. Over time, the company pivoted from consulting to providing software.

Petroleum Experts has 420 customers and offers complex products with features such as multi-phase network modeling and optimization and thorough dynamics fluid characterization package. The company made 78 million pounds in revenue (about 100 million USD) and about 67 million of it was profit. They paid a dividend of 41 million pounds (about 60 million USD), which went directly to the owner.

The company's biggest expense is its employees. It employs 86 people, with each employee costing an average of 101,000 pounds per year. Consequently, they generate around 911,000 pounds in revenue per employee.

One of the hosts shares entrepreneurial takeaways, emphasizing the importance of focus and time. He mentions that the company took 15 years to reach 10 million dollars in revenue, which may seem like a long time, but he argues that it's acceptable. He uses the example of Jeff Bezos and his regret minimization framework to support his argument, as well as examples from other founders who didn't have a clear picture of their company's future potential but pursued their ideas nonetheless​1​.
